# 📊 CodeAlpha_Unemployment_Analysis

This project is part of the **Data Science Internship** at [CodeAlpha](https://www.codealpha.tech/).  
It focuses on analyzing unemployment trends in India using Python, particularly exploring the **impact of COVID-19** on unemployment rates.

## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze and visualize unemployment rate data.
- Understand how COVID-19 affected different regions.
- Detect patterns, trends, and regional variations in unemployment.
- Provide meaningful insights through data visualizations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib** – for data visualization

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle – Unemployment in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india)
- The dataset contains information about state-wise unemployment in India.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key steps performed:
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset using `pandas`.
2. Explored trends using line plots and heatmaps.
3. Analyzed the **unemployment rate variations** over time and by region.
4. Visualized the impact of **COVID-19** on employment using graphs.
